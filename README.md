# Beasts of the Floating Seas - Personal Contributions

## 1. Game Synopsis

In Beasts of the Floating Seas, the player's objective is to hunt mythical giant creatures scattered in a world of clouds. This game is similar to Shadow of the Colossus in the sense that is all about tracking and defeating giant bosses.

For this prototype, we have created the main game systems. That is, the player can travel around the world in his floating ship and hunt the first giant creature. In order to do so, the first action is to spot the creature using the ship's periscope. Once spotted, the player needs to get to the monster and use the harpoon gun to immobilize it. Lastly, the player needs to shoot the monster's weak spot in order to defeat it. The following paragraphs summarize my personal contributions to the project.
